# V1.3-XRP-3D-Printing-Files
These are the latest printable files for the XRP robot, they may be read into any slicer and prepared for printing. Solidworks CAD files are available by request only at this time.

For printing we recommend .2mm layer height, 5% fill, two outer layers, three top and bottom layers.  Grid fill pattern is preferred, no brim (unless you need it).  Take note of the breakaway details, this governs the orientation of parts on the bed.

The files have all been tested on a Bambu Labs P1P printer, but they can be printed on other machines as well.

The XRP kit ships with 7 printed plastic parts:

(1) Single Part Frame: the main chassis for the robot. all the other part attach to this chassis. (includes breakaway support material that can be removed after the print).  This should be printed upside-down, with the logo side against the bed.

(1) Reflectance Sensor Bracket : a clip to attach the reflectance sensor to the frame. (includes support material that can be removed after the print)  

(1) Peripheral - Ultrasonic Clip : a clip to attach the ultrasonic distance sensor to the frame (includes support material that can be removed after the print) 

(1) Lifter Hook : a little lifter arm that attaches to the servo 

(1) Lifter Clip : the clip that attaches the servo to the frame

(1) Battery Cover : a cover for retaining the batteries that snaps into the bottom of the chassis

(2) Wheel: the wheel that attaches to the motors. You'll need two for your robot!
